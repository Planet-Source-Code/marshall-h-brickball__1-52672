### Description

BrickBall is a breakout-type game that uses BitBlt very efficiently, in fact this game runs full speed on a 486! It is also made for 256-color systems. (uses a palette). If you want to make efficient 2D games, here is your start.

Use the mouse to move the paddle, and hit the ball into the bricks. There is also a level editor just in case you feel you need one..

Let me know how this works, vote if you like it!
